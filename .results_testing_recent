changed to bright (very!) blue on flasher.

Branch of a branch seems the right model for the git
branch structure, as the commit count is higher in
(this) sub-branch.

    Able to modulate the power sense NeoPixel color to any
    desired shade.

    Set to magenta, at the moment -- unit will flash 5 times
    when there is a power sense event -- in magenta, this time
    (Factory color is red, here).

END.
