A simple pin toggle produces a 32 kHz pattern on
the oscilloscope (the oscope reports it as 32 kHz
and the math looks right).

This is true of each Atmel Start program run, from
any sources found (circuitpython, and happyday's
repos, as well as atmel start itself).

Hoping saw-saw already has a better way, or at least
an indication of how it's done right.
