# Local Modifications - wa1tnr

Intent is to dismantle Adafruit Seesaw to see how it
acts, as a more generic development platform for the
Adafruit SAMD21 target boards.

Initial platform is the Cricket (CPX variant) as it
is already a proven, capable, ATSAMD21G18A platform
(as a stand-alone target board).


Not sure how much of the remainder of this README still
obtains (it's from the upstream source; was edited here,
somewhat).

## Build

### Requirements

* `make` and a Unix environment
* `python` in path?
* `arm-none-eabi-gcc` and `arm-none-eabi-g++` in the path

### Build commands

The default board is `crickit`. You can build a different one using:

```
make BOARD=debug

possible targets ('BOARD='):
  charLCD
  crickit
  debug
  joyFeather
  miniTFTWing
  TFTShield18
```

add `DEBUG=1` to the `make` command to enable UART debug logging. The default UART TX pin is `PA04` and the default baud rate is `115200`. Note that there may not be enough available flash to enable UART debug loggnig on smaller chips such as the SAMD09. Also note that the I2C Slave interface will not be able to accept commands as fast while UART debug logging is enabled and use of the flow control pin is required.

### Generating a new configuration

A new configuration can be generated by running:
```
./generate.py
```
from the repository root directory and then answering the series of prompts that follows. Note that this script currently only supports SAMD09-based configurations.
