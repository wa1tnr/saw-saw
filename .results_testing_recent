    Feather M0 Express - port complete (not much to it).

    gpio realized.

    The D13 style onboard LED now blinks.
    The NeoPixel onboard the Feather M0 Express also blinks.

    BOARD=feather_m0_express is the new default target.

    Program binary upload now ~1500 bytes (compile is
    quite brief).  Was: about 10x that.

    Most hooks are now inactive.  Object files no longer
    compiled (they have been removed from the Makefile.

    BOARD=crickit is the new default; this works:

    $ make clean ; make

    Several colors showing sequentially, on NeoPixel,
    after a reset.

    main() ends with a 'while(1)' loop.

     . . .

    Good working demo; modification to main.cpp to
    allow just this demo code to run.

    .. In practice; no real effort made to remove
    existing code or hooks -- that gets (somewhat)
    bypassed, in main().

    changed to bright (very!) blue on flasher.

    Branch of a branch seems the right model for the git
    branch structure, as the commit count is higher in
    (this) sub-branch.

    Able to modulate the power sense NeoPixel color to any
    desired shade.

    Set to magenta, at the moment -- unit will flash 5 times
    when there is a power sense event -- in magenta, this time
    (Factory color is red, here).

END.
